  An eccentric group of four business and arts undergrads come together to form The Cheap Flights, Toronto-based indie band infused with a feel of pop and rock. Ben, Noah, Dan and Nick came together with the help of our very own Musicians@Ryerson, and have been jamming together ever since. <br/><br/>

It was Noah’s drummer profile posted on the M@R page that first got him in touch with the band's current lead singer, Dan, and after bringing guitarists into the mix, they were ready to hit centre-stage. 
 <br/><br/>
Crediting their inspirations to well-known Toronto start-ups like Born Ruffians, as well as The 1975 and Tokyo Police Club, the group feels their music best reflects the sound of Philadelphia-based band, CRUISR. <br/><br/>

Their very first band experience came together during a Ribfest festival, which was heavily dotted with family and friends. Since then, the group has been on the up and up, doing crowd-pleasing shows at Toronto joints like The Rivoli and Horseshoe Tavern, bringing in bigger crowds to every show with the most enthusiastic fans, who have been applauding the group’s epic stage presence and upbeat numbers from their first big-time show. 
<br/><br/>

We played our set, but everybody was our fan and they wanted us to play more," Ben and Noah described. <br/><br/>

They were told to end their set after 25 minutes of playing overtime, but that didn't stop the band from giving their audiences what they came for. 
<br/><br/>
"They cut off our vocalists mic too, but we just kept playing."  
<br/><br/>
The group’s diverse interests were initially explored through experimenting with other genres, and even picking up instruments on their own. The drummer Noah, spent years playing piano and guitar, literally stumbled upon the drums. 
 <br/><br/>
"On the side of the road in my hometown of Burlington, there was an old drum kit, so I picked it up and carried it home,” he recalled. “I played that for a year and a half and I bought some better drums and have been playing that ever since." 
<br/><br/>
   The lively company in attendance at the band's shows give each night the intimate, welcoming vibe present in each of their performances. Most importantly, the band is sure to mingle with their friendly crowds between sets. 
 <br/><br/>
"We just play our music and hope that people enjoy it. Dan is a great front man, he's good at hyping people up at the shows," Ben said.

"It's like we're all hanging out and there's a portion of the night where we're playing music, we don't go up and play music and expect you to applaud,” he continued. “We drink with our friends beforehand then go play 6-7 songs then get off the stage and hang out a bit more.” 
<br/><br/>
The band currently has a 7-8 song repertoire, with tons more under their belt. 
<br/><br/>
From recording their first single in their living room to producing their new records in studios, The Cheap Flights are anticipating the release of their newest single, Tell Me So, coming to airwaves next week. Candle Recording Studio has helped them along with recording, as well as the insight of their musical mentor, Michael. A music video is also set to follow the release of their upcoming single. 
<br/><br/>
As their own songwriters, the four split up the creative process when it comes to writing and recording new material, bringing their own poetic spunk and melodic ideas to the forefront. 
<br/><br/>
"We all write our own parts to it, there's no way we could put writing on one person,” Ben and Noah claim. "The first jam I had with all the guys together, we wrote our song we have out now called City Line."
<br/><br/>
The inspiration for their hit song? Girls. While the topic seems to be every indie band's muse, the electric and no-nonsense "if you wanna dance just tell me so" chorus resonates with audiences immediately. 
 <br/><br/>
"I find that a lot of indie music is simplistic, so there's guitar parts in it but they're not really testing peoples' abilities, and that's what's nice about our music," they say. "We get to do some cool guitar riffs where they normally wouldn't be present in a song."  
<br/><br/>
The band always opens with City Line to get the cheery vibes flowing. Every show is catered to a friendly, fun-loving audience that is ready to jam with the band as they live in the moment of their time together. 
<br/><br/>
"I think the mission statement of The Cheap Flights is 'let's play music as loud as we can for as long as we can' and see how that works out," Noah states. "I think we're more focusing on seeing how much we can get recorded when we have time and energy and while we're still young." 
<br/><br/>
And their youthful disposition towards the future proves just how they get their audiences so engaged in their performances.
<br/><br/>
"I think Dan will be on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in five years."
