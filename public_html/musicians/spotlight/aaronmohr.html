    <h1>Spotlight: AARON MOHR</h1>

  <tr>
    <td>Aaron Mohr fits the description of the modern-day musician: elusive, soft-spoken, and effortlessly cool. His black denim-clad legs are sprawled out on the grass, his frame resting on his elbows for support. Every so often, he runs his fingers through his thick wavy hair that lands just above his shoulders. His eyes are shrouded by sharp black sunglasses; he could easily pass as a third member of the Blues Brothers.<br /><br />
    
	The modern-day musician is dynamic, versatile and eclectic—he wants to learn it all, know it all, and master it all—and is able to, now more than ever, with the help of the internet. As a self-taught keyboardist, guitarist, vocalist, producer and graphic designer, Mohr is, to say the least, a jack of all trades and a soon-to-be master of all.
<br /><br />

	However, every artist has a niche, and Mohr has carved out a musical niche that fuses organic and electronic music to create a sound that is all his own. <br /><br />
    
    Mohr was influenced by Remix Artist Collective, better known as RAC, a group of international musicians who create electronic and dance remixes for musical artists.  <br /><br />

Anna Wiebe) by Electric Environment</a></iframe></td>

    "I was inspired in that realm because they use organic instruments and blend them with electronic elements," he explains. "I try to merge everything into one. It has to sound natural to me." <br /><br />
    
	Mohr's music puts you in a dreamlike state. His sweet and soft vocals and the mellow sounds of his guitar and piano work in sync with the synthesized drum beat echoing in the background. Although he does use programmed sounds and an audio processor to alter the pitch of his voice, there is nothing artificial about the emotion heard in his voice and the meaning behind his lyrics. <br /><br />
     
	As one of the founders and frontmen of a "tropical pop" band called The Electric Environment, Mohr is fairly new to the solo music scene. Native to Owen Sound, the band started in 2009 as an indie rock band to compete in the local high school's Battle of the Bands. Over the past four years, it has evolved into an experimental group that is constantly reinventing itself, whether it is through the recording, producing, or performing process. <br /><br />
    
    Mohr says their objective is to make people feel good and to create an "electric environment" where you can forget about your worries and be taken to another place. <br /><br />
     
	<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="340"><p align="left"><img src="images/AM2.JPG" width="300px" /></p></td>
    
<td>
	"We like bringing something new, such as clapping sounds, or the new addition to our band, our saxophone player, Jake Scott," he says. "We want to shy away from the norm." <br /><br />
    
	And they certainly shy away from the norm. The band's logo and album artwork is all designed by Mohr, a second-year Graphic Communications Management student, and all of the mixing and producing of their music is done by Mohr and Mitch Evans, the other founder of EE.<br /><br />
    
	"It's awesome to be able to play with your friends and jam," Mohr says with a grin. "But you do have to make sacrifices. I'm a bit of a control freak that way." <br /><br /></td>
    </tr>
</table>
    
	Since all of the members are full-time students, EE has been taking temporary breaks from making music. This has given Mohr the motivation to work more intensively on his solo projects and reminds him how much he appreciates having both the band and his solo work to fuel his musical desires.  <br /><br />
    
	That is not to say he hasn't experienced any difficulties in finding what triggers his artistic side and keeping the creative flame burning. In the beginning, when he was trying to discover his own sound, he refused to listen to the sound of his own voice.  <br /><br />
    
	"You work on a song for a month and you listen to it one day and it sounds terrible," he laughs. Despite the bad vocal performances, after hearing his recordings on repeat for hours on end, he began to grow fond of his voice. The nonstop moments of self-doubt he had, disappeared once he "learned to have faith, to trust" in himself. <br /><br />
    
	While most musicians draw their inspiration from other artists and seek to emulate their style, Mohr's familiarity and passion for graphic design moves him to be inspired by other visual artists such as filmmakers, graphic designers, directors and producers. <br /><br />
     
	"I'll be watching a film and see a really cool scene that will stick with me," Mohr smiles. "I'll then try to record songs that sound like what I just saw. I will watch it repeatedly and say to myself, 'I want to sound like this.'" <br /><br />
    
	Spike Jonze, the director of the film Where the Wild Things Are, and visual designer and musician Tycho, are just two of his major influences. Tycho is an American artist known for his ambient music that "perfectly matches with his photography and design work." <br /><br />
    
	Mohr is enthusiastic about what lies ahead. Even if he doesn't find a way to achieve a successful, professional career in music, his ideal job after school would be to design merchandise and logos for artists and music-related events. <br /><br />
     
	Armed with his Macbook and his Launchpad, the modern-day musician is always finding new ways to produce music that resonates with him and hopefully resonates with his listeners too. Whether the music is purely acoustic, completely electronic or a mix of both, Mohr will never stop testing his creative boundaries when it comes to his music.
