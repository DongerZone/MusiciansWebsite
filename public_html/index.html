	<h2>With a Little Help from my Friends</h2>
	<pre>Posted on March 9, 2014</pre>
	With the never-ending cold weather, the idea of staying inside by yourself with a cup of hot chocolate and all seven Harry Potter movies can be tempting. But this week at Musicans@Ryerson, it’s all about reconnecting – with your instruments, your peers, and your friends.
