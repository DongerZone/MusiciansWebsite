    <td>Maccie Paquette isn't your average singer-songwriter. This Toronto-based soulful pop-rock performer doesn't only use her talents for the sake of sound; Paquette is also a youth advocate who believes in positivity through the arts. For the past two years, Paquette has been professionally pursing music while blending her passion for human rights issues to become an instrument of change in the world.<br /><br /> 
    
    From a young age, Paquette has had a strong interest in music, particularly singing. She learned to play piano by ear after a year of lessons that taught her she was unable to read music. Since then, she has picked up guitar and djembe. However, unlike most artists, the music she was exposed to at a young age did not influence her current style and taste.<br /><br /> </td>

  </tr>

	"My childhood was really crazy," Paquette says. "I grew up in a foster home where they were very religious, so all we were allowed to listen to was Christian rock... When I was growing up I lived a very sheltered life, but when I was 16 I was thrown into a new environment and was allowed to and able to start thinking on my own...So, I didn't have influences as much as idols.. I love Ray Charles, I love Beyonce, I love Eminem, I love Tupac, so I can't say they've specifically influenced my sound, but they've definitely influenced how I would like to be perceived."<br /><br /> 

	Paquette's sound is a rare mix of soul, pop, and rock with heavy rhythm patterns. Lyrically, Paquette lingers on a heavy theme of love pouring out in soulful verses. However, her new single, Lioness, showcases a different side to this upcoming singer.<br /><br />  
	
	"Lioness is a very wild song," Paquette admits. "I didn't want to get put into a box immediately...but I am a lover. I'm a big lover. My music very honestly is my soul...it's literally my dirty secrets. I think because of my past I've experienced so much pain that a lot of that pain comes out into my music. It's my music, it's who I am." <br /><br />

	All of the soul she pours out into her music definitely shows on stage. She has performed at a myriad of events throughout Toronto since she began pursing music professionally. When talking about being on stage, Paquette proudly states, "I don't get nervous. I get excited. The only things I get anxious about are technology things. I don't get nervous about performing, because that's my favourite thing in life, just looking over a crowd, just being up there with my band." <br /><br />

	She recalls her favourite show as her performance at Youth Day in Dundas Square in 2012. Youth Day gives children the chance to perform in front of 20,000 people by lending the stage to over 120 different music acts made up of young people. 
In Paquette's opinion, "Youth Day gets better each year. Every one is more fun, but I think the best was Youth Day last year. I remember I was a bit nervous for it. I was just nervous because there were thousands of people, but I loved it though! I wasn't really nervous about the people, I just wanted to be good."<br /><br />

    <td width="340" height="450"><p align="left"><img src="images/maccie1.jpg" width="300px" /></p></td>
    <td>Paquette's past has heavily influenced her involvement in such issues, mainly in regards to human rights and the foster care system. Her upbringing in a foster home was far from loving, which is why she intends to make a difference. <br /><br />

	"[My past] is definitely what brought me into this place," Paquette says, carefully choosing her words. Having her fingers on the keys or wrapped around a pen made the difficulties in Pacquette's life more bearable. However, she maintains that the past still lingers over her today. "It's definitely influenced my mission as an artist because I not only want to perform full time, but eventually I want to change the foster care system of Canada, because we're taught we're broken and not beautiful and that's all a lie." <br /><br />

	But Paquette does more than talk: she has already kicked-off her own human rights initiative here at Ryerson. Her project, Living Rights, was sparked in collaboration with a few other students from Ryerson. Their objective is to help introduce and educate people about the 30 basic rights outlined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which many people are withheld from. By infusing her love for music, she wrote and produced a song to go along with a video she made that showcased her friends and family explaining their understanding of each human right. <br /><br />

    Living Rights proved to be an extremely successful project, as it recently screened at the Geneva Summit when it represented Canada on the world platform for human rights. The video received a standing ovation and Paquette's representative received many requests to have the video showcased in various countries.<br /><br /> 
    
    "It's crazy. Just this time last year is when we even started to conceive [the project]," Paquette says. "I knew I wanted to do something with music and human rights, but I didn't know how. The people that I worked with really helped shape that vision to make it happen literally not even a year later. It's crazy..it was only released in March!"<br /><br />

	Right now, Paquette is trying to focus on releasing an EP so she can begin to "expand her empire." She has recently recorded her first full length EP, but she is contemplating restarting the entire project. <br /><br />

	"I'm in a really weird position right now, if I want to just release it or if I want to redo it to perfection," she says uncomfortably. Her internal debate has been fueled by the differences of opinion by people in her close circle. Holding back on the release is some "I really want this project to represent me to my fullest. Lioness was a wild side to me I wanted to show the world. This project is more intimate; it's definitely very, very close to my heart, and I just want it to be perfect."<br /><br />
    
    Paquette's current goal is to just get her recorded material out so she can gather a wider interest. Her future objectives are to become extremely wealthy through music, and to put the money straight into helping the foster care system in Canada in addition to aiding war-torn countries in Africa.<br /><br />

	"I want to start to lift the next generation," Paquette says sincerely. "I want to take care of my family and take care of my mom. I want to change the foster care system and be the person to make a difference. I want to have an empire and take care of everyone. I don't know if I can take care of everyone, but Canada is a start."<br /><br />

	Until then, Paquette will continue sharing her message of love and peace with everyone while promoting positivity through the arts. Spreading positivity through the arts is a message she wants everyone to understand. As she puts it, "art is soul. It's whatever your soul does, it's whatever, it could be a math problem! You might not be able to tell a simple equation makes something, but when a mathematician looks at it, they can envision the dimensions for some beautiful building. Art is the wind through the trees. It's whatever sets your soul free. It's whatever frees you. Hopefully it's not something horrible, like genocide. It's whatever frees your soul in a positive way."<br /><br />

	She talks with wisdom beyond her years, which is seen through her soulful lyrics as well. "Pay attention," she says sternly. "Keep your eyes and ears open. You are everything you need. You are everything you think you are. You are as strong as you think you are. If you want to make a difference in your life, you can." <br /><br /><br />
