As he leans back in his chair, rapper Will Lofsky casually poses the question philosophers have lost sleep over for centuries: "What is reality?"<br/><br/>
  Ever since Lofsky learned about metaphysics, his mind and rap lyrics have been open to a whole new world of personal discovery. <br/><br/>
  "I go down the rabbit hole a lot in my raps," Lofsky explains. "I want to wake people up, so I talk a lot about enlightenment and the pursuit of happiness." <br/><br/>

    <td>
  
Lofsky's spiritual side is quite prominent in both his lyrics and his music videos. In collaboration with his friend Brad Golding, he filmed the video for his song Universe in the church he was baptized in as a child to showcase his belief that God is everywhere and everything. <br/><br/>
  Lofsky, a first year New Media student, acknowledges that philosophy and the enlightenment are not always appealing to some listeners. He realizes that people also enjoy songs with more applicable subject matter, such as the theme of money and drugs that appears so commonly in rap. Lofsky always pushes for a deeper meaning in his songs as he strives to share his own beliefs and views with the world.  <br/><br/>
  "My message as an artist is I want people to pursue knowledge and love, and I want people to find that appealing and cool," Lofsky explains. "There's more to life than just women, money, and doing drugs." <br/><br/>
While Lofsky has always been a hip-hop fan, he found the courage to start creating his own raps in the tenth grade. He counts Odd Future, particularly Earl Sweatshirt, as one of his greatest influences because of their outrageous lyrics and bravery to say whatever they want. Lofsky himself is quite outspoken, which helps him stand out amongst the crowd of aspiring rappers. <br/><br/>

"I feel a lot more comfortable rapping than talking." he admits, despite being an intelligent and articulate speaker. "When I rap I'm not afraid to make people feel uncomfortable; I want people to feel a lot of emotion in my music." <br/><br/>
  In addition to Odd Future he lists his father Lorne Lofsky, a jazz guitarist, as one of his biggest influences. Lofsky grew up listening to his father improvise on the guitar which motivated him to start freestyling.  
  <br/><br/>
  When questioned about where he hopes to be in a few years, Lofsky looks out the window and takes a minute to think. He is a thoughtful character who seems to always consider others in his plans. In the future he hopes to build a studio in Newmarket with a few of his friends and create his own label, but not just for his own benefit: Lofsky hopes to be able to mentor younger rappers who are just starting to get into the industry. He additionally wants to sign local artists and scout at Ryerson, as he recognizes the endless talent eager to be showcased. <br/><br/>

  "I want to give people opportunities they would not normally have," Lofsky says carefully. "There isn't a single stupid person in the world, there's just a lot of people just don't have a direction." <br/><br/>
  Lofsky continues to write new songs every day. Currently, he has a mixtape under construction which will be dropping on April 20th. His determination and motivation to succeed is admirable, as he recognizes that he will not go anywhere unless he works hard every day.
