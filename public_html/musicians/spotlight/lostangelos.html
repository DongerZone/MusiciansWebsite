     In the spirit of rock and roll, an eccentric group of four musicians from the town of Waterdown, Ontario, is redefining the sounds of The Sheep Dogs infused with the dreamy vibe of the 1960s, all freshly created from a wood cabin on one of the band members’ family farm. 
<br/><br/> 
This is the sound produced by a group of old friends—Luke Krznaric, Ryan Gaynor, Max Boyko, and Nik Hirst-- from different universities, making people dance energetically and reminisce to hazy summer festival days, all within the same sound. They are The Lost Angelos. 
<br/><br/>
Back in high school, the curator of the band, Ryan, was working a co-op program at a TV station, where his fellow coworker and friend tagged along with him on the journey to becoming The Lost Angelos. When a drummer was needed for his friend’s high school performance, they went out to the show and went to one practice with the bassist of his band, where they thought to make their own band out of music they wanted to play. 
<br/><br/>
Although the school show didn’t turn out for the young musicians, it did bring them together on their first gig together, one of many to come. The group of 4 have also went their separate ways in universities, with only the band’s drummer, Ryan, being a part of the Ryerson community, but their musical bonds continue to persist. 
<br/><br/>
While the band has coined on covers from their favorite artists and has brought their own authentic feel in original pieces, you can always hear a bit of their influences coming out in their own sound. This vivacious feel of blues, folk, and rock sounds work together to grab attention and get people dancing. And as for their musical goal? Keeping classic rock alive.  
<br/><br/>
“We love old school rock and roll,” Ryan says. “We kind of want to carry on the traditions we love in the music that we listen to.” 
<br/><br/>
The Lost Angelos as a name may remind people of a vintage San Francisco, and was actually semi-inspired by a lyric in The Doors’ LA Woman. They’ve come a long way from their starter names like Traffic Jam and The Hut Men, but they’ve found that The Lost Angelos would resonate with listeners most, and that rings true. 
<br/><br/>
“We like that it’s a witty name that you’re not going to take too seriously, we just wanted it to be a fun name,” Ryan says.
<br/><br/>
As The Band, another 1960’s-Toronto inspiration for these guys, is still heavily inspiring to their sound, what really helped their name come together was an out-in-the-woods, campfire setting feeling that stems from the band’s jamming together in their cabin setting, paired with a spinoff of Los Angeles that matches the lighthearted personalities of the band members. 
<br/><br/>
Their first gig, RTA band night at The Central, a big move from backyard family parties, was a phenomenal experience for the guys as they found they were completely at ease on stage. They played mostly original material and a few covers, and have come a long way since their first time on stage together.
<br/><br/>
“We’ve really tightened up as a band and developed a sound,” Ryan says.
<br/><br/>
Although they haven’t had vocal lessons, the band is able to come together collectively with harmonized vocals. They’ve all discovered their own styles, and have realized what each individually has felt more comfortable with and excelled at in bringing the live music forward. 
<br/><br/>
“We know what stuff each one of us is good at singing and we take it that way,” Nik, the band’s keyboardist, says.
<br/><br/>
People were dancing to the tunes by the boys, even though the sound was coming from 18 year olds doing covers of songs that made them dance in a way like nobody was watching—a carefree time transporting listeners to 1960’s Woodstock. 
<br/><br/>
“The goal is to make honest rock and roll that we have fun playing, and music that we’d want to associate with… For us, we try to take a very genuine approach to it, we don’t want it to turn it into a game,” says Nik.
<br/><br/>
As time has gone on, the guys have been able to produce more complicated material, while simultaneously growing their fan base. “Misty City Blues” written by Ryan, has become their routine finale song, especially thanks to its high-energy style that ends of everyone’s night in good vibes. 
<br/><br/>
The foreseeable future for the band is primarily getting in the studio and recording—a step up from recording in Ryan’s own home. The band also hopes to produce an album that has a good 2-3 songs ready to go for radio.
<br/><br/>
“We wanted to have a classic rock, road to rock with harmonies… The Sheep Dogs have that sound and that’s what they’re going for,” Nik says.
<br/><br/>

    <h5><em>Fans of The Lost Angelos will be pleased to know that the guys have new material in the works, which will be released on their SoundCloud channel in what they hope will be the near future, and their future events are posted on their Facebook page:
