	A nostalgic looks crawls across Rachael Kennedy’s face when she remembers the first song she ever wrote. She gazes off into the distance, letting the memory resurface. Kennedy suddenly recalls a surprising event that followed the writing process: the moment that she put her pen down and let what she had just created sink in. <br /><br />

“Honestly, I think I cried,” she admits. “I was just so overwhelmed. It was one of the only times I felt like I had a true epiphany, when I was like ‘This is it. This is what I want to do.’” <br /><br />
 
Since that moment, the fourth-year Arts and Contemporary Studies student has blended her soul into her music. She draws inspiration from experiences that overwhelm her and leave her in awe. To describe her sound, Kennedy asks you to imagine if Carole King had a granddaughter who grew up next to Coldplay, whose best friends were Ed Sheeran, Imogen Heap and Tegan and Sara. This eclectic combination results in a unique sort of alternative pop vibe with a raw, organic sound when performed acoustically. <br /><br />

At the age of 15, Kennedy picked the guitar over piano as her musical weapon of choice. She was drawn to the guitar because of her desire to learn a song by her favourite musical duo, Tegan and Sara. Kennedy reveals she shied away from piano in an effort to distinguish herself from her older sister. <br /><br />


Kennedy explains that her family is well versed in music, which contributed to her own interest in the art. In addition to her sister’s piano skills, Kennedy’s father is involved with musical theatre and her mother, Mary-Lu Zahalan, is a Juno-nominated artist for Most Promising Female Vocalist in 1983. Zahalan’s accomplishments, which include three albums and reaching the finals for the Miss Canada pageant, are in equal parts inspirational and a lot to live up to. <br /><br />

“It was so much pressure to show my parents [my first song] because I was so shy when I first started,” Kennedy says. “And my parents know music, they know what’s good, so I knew they would be straight up about it. But they couldn’t believe I had written [the song].” <br /><br />

For Kennedy, her family is her most treasured support system. They are in full favour of her decision to pursue music as a career and have even recommended her to key people in the industry, such as her current vocal coach. Her mother has been a wonderful source for advice, especially for handling the business-related aspects of a career in music. She knows how to deal with contracts and record labels, which helped Kennedy navigate the technical side of her career. <br /><br />

Despite her passion to delve into the music industry, success isn’t the only thing on Kennedy’s mind. Kennedy wants to find ways to fuse performing with raising money for charity. This past holiday season, she donated half the proceeds from her Christmas single “I’ll Be Home For Christmas If You Want Me” to Charity Water, an organization that brings safe drinking water to economically underdeveloped nations. She has also partnered with Sick Kids and performed at the Terry Fox Run at Western University in the past, and hopes to collaborate with them again in the future. <br /><br />

“It’s just beyond amazing to think music can [help] people,” Kennedy exclaims. “And then to think the music I create can do that, well that’s like a whole other level!” <br /><br />
