Bound by a shared curiosity for music and childlike fascination with one another, Jordan Francescangeli and Julia Wittmann are not your average dishevelled indie musicians. The acoustic guitarists’ musical collaboration was sparked by a “big crush”, or falling in love with the other’s mind.
<br /> <br />
“We were really fascinated with each other,” Francescangeli says of their first encounter at St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School in Cambridge, ONT. “We developed this creative relationship where we would write songs for each other...It was kind of like this mutual adoration.” 
<br /> <br />

Even though they craved each other’s company, the singer-songwriter duo didn’t get to know each other through coffee dates or incessant texting. “We never talked,” Wittmann says with finality. The first year Radio and Television Arts student explains how they would write acoustic pieces to communicate and respond to the other’s material. “It was always done through subtle lyrics.” 
<br /> <br />

And they still use this model today, with the slight modification of talking through critiques and bouncing opinions back and forth on melodies, chord progressions, and samples. For now, Francescangeli and Wittmann are two independent artists working in collaboration, but forming a band is a possibility they hope to consider through their growth as musicians.

When they aren’t finding inspiration from each other, Francescangeli and Wittmann’s muse is the world of literature and art. They navigate through other creative forms in search of words, images, or moments that can inspire stories in their own music. 
<br /> <br />
“I’ll go to Julia’s house, and we’ll look through books and find words we like, and put stuff together,” the second year Graphic Communications Management student says, adding that they have done this with novel’s like Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. “We like to create a concept and write from the point of view of someone else, and use it to understand our situations.”
<br /> <br />
Artists like Grimes, Alt-J, Lights, and Chairlift are also an inspiration for the duo. They love the ethereal stylings of British band London Grammar, and swelling, reverberating sounds in songs like Ellie Goulding’s “Dead in the Water”. While many alternative music fans can be pretentious in their criticisms of mainstream pop artists, Francescangeli and Wittmann openly admit to loving whatever sounds good, including Taylor Swift. Francescangeli laughs, adding that he even named his pet rat after her (the other rat is called Blueberries). 
<br /> <br />
“If you are human, you have to like Beyoncé,” Francescangeli smiles. Despite leaning towards deeper thematic concepts in their music, the pair agree that having fun is a real emotion. “Outside of yourself you have to make music that other people will get...but at the same time, you have to be honest.”

The song “No Angel” on Beyoncé’s latest album was written by indie songwriter Caroline Polachek from Chairlift, a band based in Brooklyn.  
<br /> <br />
“I want her career,” Wittmann says of Polachek. She imagines her career in music eight years from now: “I’m 26. I live in downtown Toronto or L.A., and I work for a songwriting company or a studio. I think I could do a mix, like engineering-slash-writing.”
<br /> <br />
Prior to that, she would also like to continue her academic pursuits with a Masters degree in English. Ultimately, whether or not her plan changes, Wittmann says, “My quest as a human being is to find out what is real.” Francescangeli jumps in, likening Wittmann’s mission to the song Reflektor by Arcade Fire.

While he won’t be pursuing music as a career, Francescangeli hopes to shadow a music engineer in-studio to learn more about production. Wittmann’s advice for musicians new to recording is “Get a keyboard, and try your hand at an instrument you are unfamiliar with because it’s a whole new territory.” She says that this can help break musicians out of familiar strumming patterns and expose them to different instrument tones. Recording and adding layers to the music is another method of writing, they say. 
<br /> <br />
Francescangeli and Wittmann’s kindred spirits are the fabric of their friendship, and music is the thread that patches those moments of adoration and discovery together.
