      He sits in the coffee shop with his arms casually cradling the back of his head, recounting the names of the seven albums he’s produced, with their kooky titles including Donkey Kong Future Worlds and Angel Dust. From his childhood gamer start to a whimsical music producer and university student, the product of a fusion of emo and hip-hop/rap is the new genre being brought to the music scene.  <br/> <br/>        Formally known as “A-Merk”, this eclectic artist combines the contrasting genres of hip-hop and emo into a concoction of sound he refers to as the “Atmospheric Alien Slapstep”. <br/> <br/>
  With the recent release of his seventh album, Angel Dust, A-Merk is looking to revolutionize the dark atmospheres of two very unlikely-paired musical genres.  <br/> <br/>      What sets this second-year Creative Industries musician apart from the rest is his construction of beats, as well as the complex stories behind his music. The sci-fi novel meets apocalyptic chaos in Angel Dust is a particularly stand-out album in A-Merk’s unconventional inventory.  <br/> <br/>     “The album takes place in the reality where church and state are one. The album is a sci-fi book in rap album form. A sci-fi novel, but instead of being a novel with chapters and events, it’s a bunch of characters speaking, and you piece the story together into several stories,” he recounts.   <br/> <br/>     The fictional cast ranges from a rebellious protagonist fighting against the Church and the State, to a cop and even a priest. The characters serve to play into larger social and political issues. For example, the cop represents abuse of power and the priest, highlighting worldwide religious uproars. <br/> <br/>      Growing tired of the stock instruments provided to Ableton users, a music generating program, he turned to samples of hip-hop influences to bring his new sound to life.  <br/> <br/>      “It’s a bunch of combinations of stuff that just sounds cool and interesting, but also vague enough that it’s not really boxing,” says the 21-year-old. “It doesn’t put anything in the box. My music is atmospheric and it’s alien and it definitely has a slap or crunch or thump and kicks to it.” <br/> <br/>       After several attempts to learn guitar and drums while growing up, A-Merk turned to Ableton to access the myriad of instruments that are used to produce his concoction of musical tones.  <br/> <br/>      “Now that I’m using Ableton so much it seems stupid to use a real instrument because it’s so limited. What can you do with a guitar that you can’t do with a few clicks of the program?” <br/> <br/>      Although his career began in writing lyrics, his passion for dropping unique beats that were sure to charm a variety of listeners was the prompt he needed to change his musical pace.  <br/> <br/>       “I started writing rap as a means of self-expression,” he says, and explains how he pursued artists who could compose the music for him. He quickly changed his mind and decided to do it all himself. “I got the program and started making my own beats and I branched out.” <br/> <br/>       Most of the lyrics A-Merk works with are an extension of his own personal feelings and channels of negative energy into a positive outlet, as influenced by underground emo-rap band, Atmosphere.  <br/> <br/>      “A lot of rap is about boasting, and I like Atmosphere because a lot of the music is about your own flaws and expressing them, just being brutally honest like an open book, it’s a good way to channel negative emotions you have into writing, and then it feels better,” he says.  <br/> <br/>   From his gaming start as a child, it comes as no surprise that A-Merk’s favourite album to produce was the eccentrically animated and character infused album, Donkey Kong Future Worlds.  <br/> <br/>      “That was the most fun to produce because that game was one of the first games I ever owned, called Donkey Kong Country, and when I played it it was way too difficult for me but I really loved it as a kid,” he says.  <br/> <br/>
       Not only does the musicality of gaming backgrounds strike A-Merk’s chord of interest, growing up with the twinkling-sounding animations has given him a new appreciation for the construction of sound.  <br/> <br/>      “I didn’t realize the amount of quality of every aspect of the game but when I went back as a 15-16 year old, the quality of the music specifically… The music is so detailed and complex and interesting and always has the right mood for the level and all these things the creators had to consider, they didn’t have all these crazy tools we have now, what they created was fantastic.”  <br/> <br/>      Whether listeners are attuned to his uniquely created genre, A-Merk is proud of the way his music has grown with the development of his most recent album. The construction of the various sounds he pieces together for a new track and the uniqueness each song has thanks to the endless selection of cartoon sounds and animations leave this 21-year-old with plenty to build on.  <br/> <br/>      “If I have three notes played on a flute sample and I have some kind of crazy noise that represents a character jumping in a cartoon, I put those two together because they sound good,” he says.  <br/> <br/>    “Whether or not people agree, whether or not they object, I like how they sound together.” <br/> <br/>
