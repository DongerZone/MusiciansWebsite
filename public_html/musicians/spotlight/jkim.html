	He wasn’t the loudest kid in high school. Nor was he the most outgoing. Actually, he was quite the opposite. Vocalist Jonathan Kim was shy, reserved, unwilling to take risks. He settled for playing sports like basketball, volleyball and soccer in school, when what he really wanted to do was join the drama club and be part of something creative, like a musical production.<br/><br/>
Growing up as an only child with a musically-inclined mother, he remembers crying a lot, thinking he was being forced against his will to sit and practise the violin every day. Although he refused to believe any good could come from those mind-numbing hours he could’ve spent watching TV and playing games, he admits now that his mother was his biggest inspiration. She only wanted to share her enthusiasm with her son so he could learn to respect the art as much as she did. <br/><br/>
It was only in church where he felt confident enough to do what he truly loved: sing. And it was when he would sing with his cousins in his small church choir as a child that he realized singing was something he enjoyed. <br/><br/>
But he had no interests in pursuing it just yet. Nobody knew he could sing, and he wasn’t ready to tell anyone, even his friends. It was when high school came along that Kim stepped out of his comfort zone and joined a singing competition. <br/><br/>
“My friends were like, ‘What? Jon, you don’t sing’,” he says to me on the phone, recalling their reactions. He lets out a hearty laugh. <br/><br/>
“I ended up winning.” I can picture him flashing a big toothy grin, the same grin he sports in his YouTube videos right before he sings his soulful rendition of a song that’s been frequenting the radio. <br/><br/>
The winner of the competition had the opportunity to sing a cover song at the radio station Z103.5. Even though he didn’t move on to the next round, Kim became enamoured with singing ever since, and he continued singing as a hobby by playing open mic nights throughout university. <br/><br/>
After completing a degree in political science at the University of Guelph, Kim didn’t feel as accomplished as he expected to feel. There was something missing. So he decided to come back to Toronto and learn about entrepreneurship at Ryerson, enrolling in the entrepreneurship major Bachelor of Commerce program. To maintain his hobby, he decided to start his first YouTube channel around three years ago, but deleted it when he couldn’t stand the thought of how embarrassing it was. <br/><br/>
“You’re always your harshest critic,” he says. <br/><br/>
Apart from singing and playing the guitar, Kim had another fiery passion—working out. He was an avid fan of CrossFit, a high-intensity strengthening and conditioning program designed to improve endurance, flexibility and overall fitness. One day, somewhere along the line, something went wrong. Kim tore a cartilage in his knee and was left with a severe injury that required an operation. <br/><br/>
He became depressed, drained from the thought of not being able to do what he loved every day. He slowly began to focus his attention on his other interests by finally opening an official YouTube channel to showcase his vocal skills. Soon enough, his injury revealed itself as a small blessing in disguise. <br/><br/>
His YouTube channel now has over 200 subscribers and 32,000 views. It features Kim in all of his videos, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar, or in his latest video, a female artist named Anna Bella for their duet collaboration of “Say Something”, a popular song by the duo A Great Big World. <br/><br/>
A fan of R&B, soul, old school and mainstream pop, Kim has an eclectic taste when it comes to music. In order to stay engaged with his community, he prefers to cover more recent songs, because “that’s what they want to hear.” <br/><br/>
Regardless of the artist he covers, whether it is Jason Mraz or Bon Iver, Kim manages to make their songs work with his natural voice. He doesn’t try to imitate Justin Vernon’s deep, resonant voice with hints of falsetto in the song “Skinny Love”, nor does he attempt to go the same pace as Jason Mraz in “I Won’t Give Up.” <br/><br/>
Kim has a sound, tone, and rhythm that is all his own, and there is an indisputable warmth to his singing that channels his passion for music every time he looks into the lens of his camera. <br/><br/>
“You gotta do what makes you happy at the end of the day. Nothing is unrealistic if you have a passion for it.” <br/><br/>
