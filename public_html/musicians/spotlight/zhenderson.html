Acoustic guitarist Zachary Henderson isn't just another hipster trying to delve into the "too-underground-for-you" music scene. Hopping into the indie bandwagon is too mainstream for Henderson. He would rather drive it.<br /><br />

The 19-year-old musician is bored by the typical love anthems that most musicians have somewhere in their repertoire. Henderson's music is focused more on issues than emotions. <br /><br />

"I stray away from the topic of love. It's too generic," Henderson says. For an adolescent who is still figuring things out, it's refreshing to hear that love and romance are not what drives him to create and perform. Henderson does, however, draw inspiration from his alternative music heroes like Radiohead and Mumford & Sons, and from the tonal quality of Ben Howard and Bon Iver. <br /><br />

The second year Politics and Governance major doesn't let his newbie status get in the way of his musical ambitions. "I'm not an experienced veteran in any way," he says. His advice? "Don't give in and don't compromise who you are." Henderson stresses how important it is to immerse yourself in your music, and stay determined no matter the obstacles you may face on the learning curve. Improvement over time is a given, which is why Henderson says he will always like his new stuff better than his old stuff.<br /><br />

Learning and experimenting with music has been a main part of Henderson's creative process. In fact, the Burlington native describes his musical background as being pretty "bare". Although he had always dreamed of being a singer in the spotlight, Henderson never believed in his voice, so he veered toward an alternative form of artistic expression: theatre. In Grade 11, he began singing and performing in school musicals and was pleasantly surprised to find out that the crowd liked it.<br /><br />

Henderson was no stranger when he started playing guitar again at the age of 16, after a decade sobering up from a bad episode of guitar lessons when he was a kid. From then on, he began playing more, doing covers first, eventually summoning the confidence to perform at open mics, and finally writing original music.<br /><br />

Henderson talked about his nerve-racking experience at his first open mic, in The Casbah in Hamilton, Ont. Despite being surrounded by friends and making it through a great performance, Henderson remembered how terrified he was singing by himself for an audience for the first time. Since then, Henderson has gone on to perform at numerous open mics, making regular appearances to many, and even full sets at some studios. One of his first performances was at Toronto's Annette Studios. It's these types of venues that Zack says he likes the most because of how intimate the setting is, which makes for a special show and cool atmosphere. He recently performed on a Ryerson radio show — The Gilberto and Lucas Show — and says he tries to do full sets at least once a month. <br /><br />

"[The main] goal as a musician is to write music both inspiring and [that] will move listeners," said Zack.<br /><br />

As a solo acoustic act, Henderson composes and performs all of his music with the help of nothing but a guitar. Although he has collaborated with other musicians such as the Toronto-based Beaudifulhors, Henderson says he isn't interested in learning other instruments and will remain loyal to his trusty guitar. However, Henderson is planning on working with drummer Dave Silani and is in the early works of getting a CD together with Dungus Records (Silani). Henderson has expressed that he wants to start collaborating, but added that "There's an intimacy you just don't get with a band… there's something special about an acoustic show if you do it right."<br /><br /></td>

Henderson understands the importance of finding niche venues that are tailored to his style. "You can't be an acoustic musician and go to a punk show," said Henderson, adding that you can't expect how the music will be received by the audience. Even though Henderson's passion for music appears to be unwavering, he said that there have been "periods of doubt where [he's] wanted to give it up" because of how frustrating it was. He describe it as a love/hate relationship that takes a lot of hard work and strength to push through for the ultimate rewarding experience of creating good music.<br /><br />
