    A large majority of Ryerson’s RTA students avoid specializing in audio. It’s hard, it’s meticulous, and it’s incredibly complex. It’s much less glorified than the stunning, picturesque qualities of video technology; the colours and sequences are easily captivating, and a lot more work has to go into crafting audio in order to elicit the same effect. The only ones who don’t give up on it, are the ones who really live for it. People like Omar Charles – the go to sound guy by day, and music producer by night.<br/><br/>

    Omar Charles graduated this fall from Ryerson’s RTA program. Originally from Grenada in the Caribbean, his family moved to Peterborough, Canada when Charles was very young, and he spent his childhood in Parkedale – a neighbourhood well known for artistic cultivation. <br/><br/>

“Audio is about fitting things into difficult spaces, and it’s hard to make it cohesive,” Charles said. “People know me now as the ‘music guy’.” It is a title bestowed on a few of the audio specialists in the program. The low popularity of audio makes people like Charles a hot commodity. <br/><br/>
His phone rumbles with requests for tracks as he’s answering this question, and we laugh. <br/><br/>
His prowess in audio techniques translates into his work on beats and for years he has been beat-making and producing. A lot of his product has a hip-hop foundation, but he likes to pull elements from other genres like trance and electronica. <br/><br/>
The best way to describe Charles’ sound, is to consider yourself falling backwards through space, and there’s no fear of impact. With a gentle wash of calm, ambient sounds, you’re reflecting on everything you pass, and these things continue to get smaller and smaller until vanishing from sight completely. The journey through the song is profound and meaningful, with no distinguishable beginning or end as there would be in a run-of-of-the-mill pop song. <br/><br/>
Charles started expressing himself by rapping about the typical narcissistic narratives: getting laid, getting rich, and getting in peoples’ faces.  <br/><br/>
“I was really cocky, very braggadocio in the way I rapped,” Charles said. “But if you strip away the ‘barz’ and commercial bullshit from most modern rap, you can find a lot of personal stories and real, literary talent.” <br/><br/>

But this isn’t a story about an angst-y rebel with a chipped shoulder and a score to settle with the police; Charles’s love for rap was the reason he became incredibly literate. Charles was the kid who always came to school with a new word in his vocabulary. If he wasn’t reading online street culture like “Hype Beast” or “Dazed Magazine”, he was on the track in a daring pursuit to become the next “Sonic the Hedgehog”. <br/><br/>
He was a drifter, and could never stay in one place for too long, but when he started getting serious about producing, he knew he wanted to go to a school that could offer him the best possible education in an expertise he truly loved – and that school was Ryerson. From there, his creative abilities were amplified. <br/><br/>

 Being stage-shy, he shifted from rapping to producing for himself as well as other students, giving himself the freedom to compose music with more profoundness. Common themes in his current track-list include loss of identity, heartbreak, and personal discovery. <br/><br/>
“’Don’t go’ is a sad, ambient song,” Charles said.  “I was thinking about where I want to be in life and who I wanna be with.” <br/><br/>
Charles explained to me that when lyrics aren’t included in a piece of music, the challenge becomes manipulating the sound so that it can evolve into a message. It needs to give people something to relate to. <br/><br/>
  “It’s difficult for me to be happy with it,” Charles said. “If it doesn’t affect someone emotionally, I feel like I haven’t done my job.” <br/><br/>
In the future, Charles plans to improve the Canadian music industry. By his thirties he’d like to work for the OMDC, (Ontario Media Development Corporation) but most of all, he wants to leave a legacy for his kids. <br/><br/>
He may not move as fast as Sonic, but he’s well on his way.
