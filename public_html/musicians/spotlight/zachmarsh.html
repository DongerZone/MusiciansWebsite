“Drumming is all about groove and feel,” says 19 year-old Zach Marsh. “You can push and pull the meter, you don’t have to be a metronome.” 
<br/><br/>
Marsh’s passion for music was sparked at an early age from listening to various genres of music. It also helps that his father, a guitarist, encouraged Marsh to take up guitar at a young age. But, this Ryerson arts and contemporary student was always more drawn to the drums. When he was about seven years old, Marsh got his first drum set and has been drumming for 12 years now. 
<br/><br/>

Having played an instrument for over a decade, the drum kit stool has become a second home for him.  “I think when I'm behind the kit, more than anything else I do, even compared to when I'm playing any of the other instruments I play, I feel like I'm doing what I'm meant to be doing,” says Marsh.
<br/><br/>

The other instruments he refers to are the bass and keyboard, which are on his long list of musical talents including singing, writing music, and playing guitar. In 2011, Marsh enlisted two other musicians in his band, Against Me Against You. After two years of performing together, Marsh began performing under the band’s name as a solo act. <br/><br/>


Marsh admits that it was intimidating when he started performing on his own. The band may be on hiatus, but Marsh keeps up his rigorous drum practice regimen five times a week. <br/><br/>


Today, the band is getting close to being ready for the spotlight. Against Me Against You now has Luis Vasquez, 20, on vocals and bass.  
<br/><br/>

When Marsh writes music for the band, he tries to bring back the 90s alternative rock aesthetic by mixing in different genres. Artists like Bob Marley and bands like the Smashing Pumpkins are major influences in its sound. And when Vasquez joined the band, Marsh says, “He brought in some Hot Chilli Peppers bass.”
<br/><br/>

“It’s a weird combination, but it kind of just gels when you put it together,” he adds.   
<br/><br/>

Both Vasquez and Marsh are between projects right now; Vasquez, who also plays in another band, and Marsh as a session drummer. Being busy hasn’t stopped Marsh from finding the time to record songs and that he soon hopes to release as a demo. 
<br/><br/>

The Against Me Against You front man is looking to expand the band by finding a new drummer and another guitarist. But watch out, because his only expectation is to a find a drummer who can keep up with the band’s unique style. 
<br/><br/>

“I need someone who can capture Jimmy Chamberlin’s franticness, Bonham’s big sound, and Ringo’s ability to really feel the song,” says Marsh. <br/><br/>


Once he’s got these roles filled, he hopes to get the band into Canadian Music Week next year. 
<br/><br/>

As for Marsh’s future, he says he’s going all the way in his music-related pursuits. “I have a lot of time to make this work out, but I’m also not willing to laze around,” says Marsh.
<br/><br/>

You can catch this musician playing drums for guitarist Joseph Piilonen, drumming every Sunday night for Michael Evans and at Canadian Music Week for singer-songwriter Jennifer Levy.
