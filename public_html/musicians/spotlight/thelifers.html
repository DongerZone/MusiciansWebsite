Anita Cazzola thought she was writing a love song. Although not exactly sure who it was for, she wanted to capture the feeling of missing a loved one and wishing to hear their promise to be, as the song goes, “Home for the Weekend”. The 19-year old played it for her older sister Liv, who had returned to visit their hometown of Guelph, Ontario after working in Toronto over the summer. “The song stemmed from me missing her and wanting her to come home. We kind of realized it then, and I was like, ‘This is kind of about you’,” Anita says. They played it together and ended up in tears. 
<br/><br/>
Liv and Anita’s sisterly love and best-friendship are palpable. The warmth of their relationship as family and musicians also comes across sonically through the music of their folk band, The Lifers. 
<br/><br/>
Liv, 21, is completing a double major in Business and Popular Music at the University of Western Ontario. She’s come to Toronto for a student work placement, a move that has once again reunited her with sister and Ryerson Interior Design student, Anita. Living together for the first time since forming their band last year has presented the sisters with new opportunities, such as a chance to perform the downtown bar circuit.

Although Liv and Anita played at social events in their hometown before officially becoming a band, living in different cities made it difficult for them to work on their music. In that time, the sisters focused on pursuing their own musical interests, only deciding to join forces in order to play at the Musicians@Ryerson Battle of the Bands concert last March. 
<br/><br/>
Liv and Anita, who had previously performed with a high school pop band called Detour, wanted to transform their image since switching over to the folk genre before the concert. “In preparation for some shows coming up in the new year, and the winter of last year especially...we wanted to re-identify ourselves with our new sound,” says Anita. 
<br/><br/>
For the sisters, these changes felt natural and went mostly undetected. After winning the Battle of the Bands, they carried on making music together, doing local gigs, and even won a songwriting contest at Western. The prize was a studio recording of up to four songs, which the girls managed to pull off on short notice. “You can’t expect a two day session to be perfect, but we kind of accepted that as part of the growing process,” Anita adds. This growth would soon materialize for The Lifers.
<br/><br/>
“It’s like when you press fast forward on your remote control, but it’s slow motion,” says Liv. In less than a year, perhaps without even fully realizing it, The Lifers had drifted off the dock. The time had come to “Set the Sails”, coincidentally the title of their debut EP. It was the nature of this journey that inspired the band’s name. <br/><br/>

“I wrote a song called ‘Lifer’, and the song was about the woes of not knowing what to do, or doubting yourself in terms of schooling. Whereas The Lifers as a band name has a positive connotation,” Liv explains. “It’s a lifelong journey for us as sisters and as musicians together. She’s not just my sister anymore. We’re in it [musical journey] for life, and we are so happy to be doing this.” 
<br/><br/>
Now that The Lifers’ journey is in motion, the sisters are approaching their band with a vision. Anita is the band’s artistic and social media director, while Liv takes care of the business side, including show bookings. However, this sister folk duo’s highest priority when it comes to developing their brand is to deliver an amazing stage act and audience experience. <br/><br/>

“A big thing for us is giving people a warm feeling, that’s what we try to convey on stage, and that’s what we convey as people,” Anita explains.
<br/><br/>
She remembers being approached by someone who told her that The Lifers’ songs  managed to communicate feelings of happiness despite their heavy subject matter. “It’s the best compliment that you can get,” she says. <br/><br/>

“I like making people happy, but I love making people cry,” Liv jumps in, quick to clarify that tears are also a form of emotional release. “The reason why I play music is to be cathartic for ourselves, and to help other people get through things.” 
<br/><br/>
Exploring difficult emotions inspires the sisters as lyricists and informs decisions they make when compiling their music. “Nora Jones’ Little Broken Hearts is so obviously a breakup album, but it’s a little bit exhausting to think about the same subject the whole time,” Liv says. <br/><br/>

Having an overarching theme is essential for an album’s cohesion, but the sisters believe it is important to explore a range of experiences to make a record more engaging. The Lifers attempt to do this not only through their lyrics, but also with different sounds. Anita’s main instrument is the acoustic guitar and Liv’s is piano, but the sisters have dabbled in the sounds of the ukelele, bass, toms, glockenspiel, banjolele, melodica, mandolin, and of course, some good old accordion. <br/><br/>

“The accordion has a rough, aggressive tone to it. It can be really great in some songs, but in others, it can detract from the meaning [of the song],” says Liv. Tone colours of the different folk instruments are a major component of their music, but the sisters maintain that their sound isn’t instrumentally based. Anyone who has heard The Lifers perform live knows that their signature sound can’t just owed to an artful combination of unorthodox instruments. Liv and Anita’s mesmerizing harmony is the heartbeat of their music and their sisterly love. <br/><br/>
