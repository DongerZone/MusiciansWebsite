In spite of the hectic crush of exam season, it was a pleasure to be able to meet and talk with Boni Jose, a local singer/songwriter/surrealist from the Arts and Contemporary Studies program here at Ryerson University. It’s somewhat unusual for a musician to label himself a surrealist, but Jose is someone who gives the impression of a dreamer living life without yielding to the fetters of reality – not to say that he doesn’t work hard for a living. <br/><br/>
Jose is 20 years old and has something of a philosopher’s soul. At the age of six, he attended church with his family and was inspired to learn the guitar. His musical ambition is whole-heartedly supported by his family. With their encouragement, music and singing has been a constant in his life. <br/><br/>

“The sense of independence that I have was sort of brought out through them,” Jose admitted self-depreciatingly, “If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be where I am now.” <br/><br/>

Perhaps that unconditional support influenced him in more ways than one. As a proud Torontonian, Jose is avid supporter of the local community. In high school, Jose was a member of the student council. One day, after some discussion amongst his friends, he began organizing an Arts Night to raise funds for cancer research. The event brought together artists from different disciplines and was a huge success, raising several thousand dollars by the end of the night.   <br/><br/>

When asked if music should have a cause, Jose answered, “Where it starts is in your community.” <br/><br/>

Although music for the sake of music is a wonderful thing, there’s definitely something to be said for artists to use their talent to promote a good cause. <br/><br/>

Jose draws inspiration from the singer Lights, who also has ties to Toronto. Jose has followed her career since she first started. Incidentally, her growth has coincided with some of Jose’s own coming-in as a singer. <br/><br/>

“I want to be like her. She’s one of those artists that take electronica and connects it to acoustic music. She makes it sound beautiful,” he confides. He explains that Lights is also very local and socially aware, and has raised funds for charities in the past. Jose’s own music generally falls under the hip hop and R&B category, but he confides that “at the end of the day, I don’t feel like I have a specific genre.” He believes at all music is interconnected. <br/><br/>

Speaking of, Jose has a rather interesting view on music in general, which can be summed up in one sentence: “Music is an individual.” <br/><br/>

Music connects us to others, he explains. When we listen to music, we feel that there’s someone there, someone we can identify with. Like many musicians, Jose also considers his guitar (an Art and Lutherie) as an old and faithful friend. But like a living thing, it, and the music it makes, still has facets yet to be discovered. It’s a rather poetic way of looking at things. <br/><br/>

Moving forward, Jose hopes to be able to sing and write songs for himself and others. After a short break for the Christmas season, Jose will be back and performing gigs in January. <br/><br/>
