     I meet Ashley Lyn by the Devonian Pond. <br/><br/>
Since her Artist Spotlight profile in February, her appearance has changed. Her hair is at least 12 inches shorter. Gone is the heavy white parka from the winter feature. In the warm summer air she is wearing a bandana shirt and jean shorts. <br/><br/>
Since the winter Spotlight Lyn has experienced many different things. <br/><br/>
“Within a short span of a few weeks, my friend and I travelled to seven countries,” says Lyn, who was in Europe earlier this summer. <br/><br/>
Lyn’s experiences in Europe opened her eyes to how much time she had to pursue her dreams at home. <br/><br/>
“We were constantly on the go from destination to destination, so we had to pack as much activities as possible<br/><br/>
“Being able to fit in all those activities in one day made me realize I’ve been slacking a bit and could be doing so much more in shorter periods when it comes to my music,” she says. <br/><br/>
Lyn’s trip was largely spontaneous and inspired her to take more risks with her life and music. <br/><br/>
“I’m used to signing more soulful music but now I’m working on more breezy things,” she says. <br/><br/>
Today, Lyn is inspired by artists like Arianne Grande and Lights. The new musical revelation came when she covered a Selena Gomez song and found she liked the style. <br/><br/>
She has also been working on an original album which she plans to release by the end of the year. She’s had to make way for new songs. With the recent style change some of her older music no longer fits the album she wants. <br/><br/>
“I’m in the process of auditions for permanent band mates,” says Lyn. “It’ll be easier to record with backing music, especially when the artists know the material right away.” <br/><br/>
Lyn’s recent haircut has helped her tune into what sort of music she wants to make. <br/><br/>
“I was a lot more concerned about what other people thought about me in the past, and I wanted to impress the majority,” she says. “Now I want to do stuff I really like so I’m branching off into different genres<br/><br/>
“My long black hair was how people remembered me, I wanted a change so I cut it and donated it to a good cause, a cancer charity. It feels good to help.” <br/><br/>
Lyn is looking to network more in the coming year. <br/><br/>
“It’s good to stand out. I meet a lot of cool people, they’re helping me make a path for the next two years and are looking into funding.” <br/><br/>
