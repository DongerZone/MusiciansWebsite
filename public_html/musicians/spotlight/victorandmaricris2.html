  From the tiny stage at the Ram in the Rye comes a tune that has every bar-goer singing and every waitress smiling – it’s the theme song from “Friends” sung by friends, Maricris Rivera and Victor Copetti. <br/><br/>
The two fourth-year students are veterans to the stage, having performed together in their band Maricris and Victor since their second year at Ryerson University. <br/><br/>
“She came up to me at an open mic and was like, “Do you know ‘Falling Slowly’ from Once?” and I said yes and then we performed it together,” says Copetti, describing how the duo formed. <br/><br/>
When performing, both Rivera and Copetti sing – forming beautiful melodies which is usually accompanied by a piano. Copetti also plays the guitar. <br/><br/>
 “One of my favourite things to do is to take a song that’s popular – like a pop song, and totally change the genre or make it a stripped down version,” says Rivera, whose passion for music arose from a musical theatre background. <br/><br/>

Copetti, who found his passion for music in high school, describes Rivera’s music style as soulful, while he enjoys funk and folk-pop.  Together they create a dynamic sound that indulges in soul, funk, folk-pop and recently, punk. <br/><br/>
“The type of music we play is versatile, we don’t stick to a genre - we try to be all over the place. It’s not like we’re creating our own genre – it’s that we’re taking aspects from different genres that we really like and we roll with it,” says Copetti, with Rivera nodding in agreement. <br/><br/>

  One of their most recent performances was at Ryerson’s Darkness Concert where musicians played for an audience in complete darkness. While most people can barely make it safely from their light switch to their bed in the dark, Rivera and Copetti learned to play an entire set without sight. <br/><br/>

“It was a really cool experience because the music really had to be felt since no one could see us,” says Rivera. <br/><br/>
In January of 2015, the duo released their first EP titled “Covered Up”, filled with their unique renditions of popular songs. Within the EP, they truly show their versatile love for music with songs ranging from “White Blank Page” by Mumford and Sons to “Love on Sunday Morning” by Beyoncé and Maroon 5. <br/><br/>
After receiving positive feedback from the EP, they decided to write their own songs. In May 2015, they recorded an original EP titled “Lost and Sounds” and it was released in July. <br/><br/>
Rivera and Copetti described writing songs as a difficult process which turns into a balancing act between the two. <br/><br/>
“It’s almost like my strengths are her weaknesses when it comes to writing songs – we balance each other out, it’s like pieces to a puzzle,” says Copetti. <br/><br/>
Both students are members of the Musicians@Ryerson group, with Rivera as the performance coordinator of the team and Copetti as the president of Musicians@Ryerson. <br/><br/>
Maricris and Victor aren’t the only band that formed from the musical student group, there are also Mayraki, The Lifers, and Little Boxer – bands who Rivera and Copetti say inspire them to become better artists. <br/><br/>
The duo hope to create a third EP with original songs early next year. Their listeners can stay updated on new music or upcoming shows by searching “Maricris and Victor” on Bandcamp and Facebook. <br/><br/>
 “Even if I’m having a stressful day there’s been a couple times when I would just sit at my piano and practice scales as a form of therapy because it’s something that I know - it’s been engrained in my life,” says Rivera, “I can’t see music ever leaving. It’s always been something that’s been there.” <br/><br/>
