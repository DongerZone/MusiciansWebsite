As Nathaniel Astudillo begins to unbutton his sweat-covered dress shirt in the densely packed Mod Club, the crowd starts screaming. For the 18-year-old singer, this was an interesting moment for the Synthetic Army.
<br/><br/> 
“People were just going nuts, like the kind of nuts that you see at a major pop concert where people are trampling over each other trying to get as close to the stage as they possibly can,” Astudillo says of the 2014 show when they opened for Toronto boy band Rebel Coast. “We were like, ‘Holy shit! People like us!’” 
<br/><br/>
And for the Richmond Hill, Ont.-based band who had never had a full house at a notorious club downtown before, this show was a big deal. 
<br/><br/>
“We could hear the crowd erupt ... after every song,” said 19-year-old drummer Jonah Blaser with a smile. “And when we finished ... I was the last one off so I said ‘Bye!’ And [the crowd] was all like, ‘AHHH!’” 
<br/><br/>
As Astudillo, Blaser, and 20-year-old guitarist and song writer Jacob Peng reminisced and bickered over each other, it became clear that they have always been a tight-knit group. When Peng was in Grade 10, he met Astudillo and guitarist Brandon Gratch. Gratch, 18, introduced them to his childhood friend, 18-year-old bassist Alex Karapetyan. They met Blaser through a mutual friend, and the Synthetic Army was officially born in 2012. 
<br/><br/>
However, things are changing for the up-and-coming band. After graduation, they were forced to put the Synthetic Army on hold as all five members split off in different directions. 
<br/><br/>
Blaser is a second-year film student at Ryerson University, Peng goes to the University of Toronto for computer science, and Astudillo is considering film and musical theatre programs at Ryerson or Western University for next year. Gratch and Karapetyan are studying at Wilfrid Laurier and Western respectively (and were unable to come down for this interview) so finding time for everyone to come together is getting harder and harder. 
<br/><br/>
“We’ve pretty much been on an extended hiatus for almost all of this school year,” Astudillo said.
<br/><br/>
But the Synthetic Army hasn’t been completely MIA. 
<br/><br/>
“We still have done a few small things,” Blaser said. “In the summer we started releasing these YouTube videos every week.... And we played a show in October.... But it was probably our least successful show.”
<br/><br/>
The band’s consensus? Let’s not talk about it. Other than that, the boys have mainly been focusing on practicing on their own. Despite the distance, the Synthetic Army remains as united and close as ever. 
<br/><br/>
“I think that we’re all passionate about music and ... about the band and getting together and playing music with each other, which I think is represented by how we’re still a band even though we’re all in different schools,” Blaser said.   
<br/><br/>
When the band does have the chance to reunite, there are a ton of positive vibes.
<br/><br/>
“When we got back together [from school] in December and we practiced, it felt really good,” Blaser said. “It [felt] like the first time. It was just fun.... I was happy.” 
<br/><br/>
The Synthetic Army has plans to start right back up again as soon as the school year is over – and they’ve got a lot of goals they want to accomplish. The first and most pressing thing on their agenda is professionally recording a new single.
<br/><br/>
“We have a lot of experience with self-recording and so with this single it’s going to be our first venture with ... going to actual studios instead of recording in basements,” Peng said.  “We’re getting stuff professionally post-produced and mixed and mastered.” 
<br/><br/>
The Synthetic Army wants their single to be brand new, even though they have an impressive arsenal of songs that have never been recorded. 
<br/><br/>
What the song will actually sound like is up in the air as of right now. But the band has previously been influenced by Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Fall Out Boy, and as of recently, post-hardcore band Pierce the Veil.
<br/><br/>
“A lot of our later stuff has been ... [angsty],” said Astudillo, sparking a defensive shout from Peng. “It’s not angsty!” he exclaimed. The boys jokingly settled on the genre of “hard-hitting melancholy alternative rock.” 
<br/><br/>
Typically, the Synthetic Army doesn’t like putting a serious label on their music.
<br/><br/>
“The idea of a genre is something that we’ve tried to escape from through a lot of our music,” Peng said. “A lot of times you can feel very restrictive [under a specific genre] so we take from a lot of different influences.”
<br/><br/>
Fans of hard-hitting melancholy alternative rock can catch the Synthetic Army in their hometown this summer, playing in Peng’s basement. The five-man band is well-accustomed to cramming their sound into small spaces: much to his father’s dismay, this show won’t be the first time they’ve brought a concert to Peng’s front doorstep.
<br/><br/>
In August 2014, the Synthetic Army held an album release show. “[It was] one of the best shows that we’ve ever played,” Peng said. “It’s been ... one of the only shows that we played in our actual hometown instead of getting people to come all the way to Toronto. It was also in my basement.” 
<br/><br/>
This show was one of the first times that the band was able to take matters into their own hands and organize everything on their own. They drew in their own crowd, handled ticket sales and merchandise, and got every single personal detail they wanted. They even got to hand-pick their own openers. 
<br/><br/>
“Something that we really like to do is curate all the talent,” Peng said, “so the show is just amazing from start to finish. Another great thing is that we give performance opportunities to people who aren’t really used to performing in those kinds of environments.”
<br/><br/>
Originally, the five members were mindful of the fact that they were literally holding a concert in a house. While they were rehearsing, they attempted to dampen the sound with big foam pads taped to the walls after being scolded by Peng’s father, who suggested that they play a little quieter. 
<br/><br/>
“For about an hour, we were trying to play quietly and [Peng’s] dad was like, ‘Okay, good! It’s better quieter!’” Astudillo said with a laugh. 
<br/><br/>
However, this effort didn’t last long.
<br/><br/>
“When he left us, we were kind of like, ‘Alright we’re just going to play loud. We can’t do this,’” said Astudillo. But, since one of their openers was a loud metalcore band, their abandoned attempts to stifle the sound soon became a problem.
<br/><br/>
As the metal band was playing, Blaser saw Peng’s father standing in the corner. “I looked over at [him],” Blaser said, “and he looks over at me and he gives me the dirtiest look and I was like ‘Hey!’” 
<br/><br/>
“He was so displeased,” Peng laughed. 
<br/><br/>
Even though Peng’s father wasn’t the happiest person in the room, the Synthetic Army was able to feed off of the positive energy from the 70 enthusiastic fans they drew in.
<br/><br/>
“The audience response was fantastic,” Peng said. Even though the bigger shows are fun, the boys find themselves feeling more at home in smaller venues. 
<br/><br/>
But, at the end of the day, the size of the venue doesn’t really matter. 
<br/><br/>
“Whether you’re in a huge venue or a tiny venue, people can either be very responsive or they can just treat you as background music,” Peng said. “So the best thing is that regardless of the size of the venue, people are really engaged, really responsive and singing along.”
<br/><br/>
As an upcoming band, the Synthetic Army has some advice for aspiring musicians in a similar situation. 
<br/><br/>
“Just be really careful about who you’re talking to and what you agree to do. Don’t sign things or agree to things that you don’t know the full extent of or don’t understand,” Blaser said.
<br/><br/>
“Also, practice all the time. I think that one goes without saying,” Astudillo added. 
<br/><br/>
The Synthetic Army released their first album, Incandescent, in 2014. A bit self-deprecating of their work at times, they will try and stay positive, even though being in a band can be quite stressful.
<br/><br/>
“It might be a little hard,” Astudillo said, “but [we’ll] try.”
