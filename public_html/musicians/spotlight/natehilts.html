  Seated on a bench in the sunny Ryerson quad, Nate Hilts recalls his first days with a guitar in hand, reminiscing about songs like Ode to Joy and Rockin’ Robin. His calm demeanor matches the quaint fall weather as he quietly ponders what music means to him. 
  <br/><br/>
  Hilts was introduced to the guitar when he was a child by his mother, and he was lucky enough to have grown into it over time as he learned to play classic rock songs by ear. He also plays the keyboard, which he uses to create electronic beats. While his songs currently do not feature vocals, he is confident that he could incorporate singing in the future. 
<br/><br/>

  For Hilts, a first year photography student, music presents a unique sort of escapism. He admires the way that music can encompass a mood or convey the emotions of the artist. One of his main goals when he creates music is to get a clear feeling across to his audience. 
<br/><br/>
  “I would say music is a very powerful tool for coping,” Hilts says without hesitation. “There have been times when I’ve needed to pass difficulties in my life and music was the only thing that was there. I wouldn't have to think about what was going on. I could just throw it on and get immersed in that kind of mood that the artist wanted you to feel.”
<br/><br/>
  While Hilts’ primary focus is on rock and blues, he also dabbles in electronic music. He recalls watching videos of electronic artist Ronald Jenkees and feeling inspired by his overall passion for what he was doing.

  “Whenever he did music, he looked like he was getting really into it,” Hilts explains. “That feeling was exactly what I was going for when I was getting into music. Even if it’s a small clip of a song, or even if I don’t think it sounds too great, I just do it. It’s the process that’s interesting to me.”

    Film is also of interest to Hilts, particularly how film and music blend seamlessly together to create a deeper cinematic experience. Hilts references Disasterpeace, an electronic artist who created the soundtrack for horror film It Follows. He is intrigued by how well the sound matches the mood of the film to create such an eerie effect. 
<br/><br/>
“If I could be a part of creating something like that, it would be very cool,” he says. “I just don’t know how people do it so well, just matching the mood the director of a movie is going for, it blows my mind.”
<br/><br/>
  While creating film soundtracks remains a long term goal, Hilts is currently focusing on becoming a more confident performer. His words of wisdom for anyone just starting out with music is to not let yourself get frustrated by theory. 
<br/><br/>
  “You get better results, in my opinion, if you go by what you think sounds good.”
