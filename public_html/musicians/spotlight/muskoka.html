Every musician has a different story when you ask them how they got into performing music. For one RTA student, it all started with a need for self- expression and an introduction to some U2 records – courtesy of dad. 
<br/><br/>
Now, eight years later, David Matta is a polished drummer, tearing up the music scene in several projects. Namely, Love Wagon and Muskoka.
<br/><br/>
The Project “Love Wagon” was born right here on Ryerson ground. It’s a 5-man ensemble made for a sixties-based pop rock sound that focuses on old goodies like The Beatles.
<br/><br/>
At an event called “Open Jamming” hosted by RSU student group “Musicians@Ryerson”, Matta met the other four other people who would soon make up the group “Love Wagon”. They hit it of immediately.
<br/><br/>
The Open Jam was an organic way of introducing campus musicians to one another through music rather than words, in order to find that perfect creative chemistry. At a university like Ryerson, the demand for music and forming bands is extremely high, and it correlates in many ways to programs like Radio and Television, because there are a lot of studio recording involved in the curriculum.
<br/><br/>
However, Matta attributes most of his musical development to an insatiable urge to do more with his early-age curiousity.
<br/><br/>
“I had a need to fit in and express myself in a different way than others did,” he said. 
<br/><br/>
“Rehearsing and practicing with bands took away from the pressures of life.”
<br/><br/>
This in part, was one of the main reasons why he eventually formed his first band, Muskoka. 
Muskoka was formed outside of Ryerson and it features Matta’s younger brother as the lyricist and lead guitarist. Muskoka is a wholesome serving of indie- rock with a side of psychedelic, topped off with a dash of funk for extra taste. The band’s soundcloud page features a collection of covers by Tame Impala – one of their largest influences. 
“In three words, we’re experimental, dedicated, and fun,” Matta said. “And sometimes we can even be a little indecisive, but don’t use that one,” he joked.
<br/><br/>
Not big on pre-show rituals, Muskoka’s members take a laid back approach using pre-show time to de-stress, connect with one another, or maybe even throw on an episode of “The Office” – a show that they all adore.
<br/><br/>
Things started to get a little bigger for Muskoka when the younger members of the band (still in high school) began to realize their own potential through a studio experience at the RCC.
<br/><br/>
 “We auditioned for Band Pass - an RTA music event – and used our song Suburbia,” Matta said.
“One of my friends was so moved by the track, that he approached me later and told me that they wanted to make a music video for Suburbia. It’s now three weeks in production.”
<br/><br/>
Suburbia is the story of childhood innocence and trying to wrestle off the idea of growing up. Becoming a man and moving on meant leaving his carefree time in Suburbia behind.
<br/><br/>
The video will convey the story through two boys who were inseparable in their youth, but as they got older, began to drift apart. One moves forward but throughout his success, he never forgets to look back.
“It’s been a huge journey planning this thing out,” Matta said.
<br/><br/>
One day, Matta hopes to see Muskoka grow beyond the boundaries of Toronto, and become a sensation. Matta is a man of strong conviction, and isn’t worried about the success of the band and joked that he wouldn’t mind getting his own key to the city. 
<br/><br/>
“I’m just not sure if they make doors that big,” he laughed.
<br/><br/>
Like the boy in Suburbia, Matta and Muskoka won’t forget to look back at where it all started, here in the six.
