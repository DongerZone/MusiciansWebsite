        Toronto is more than just a dot on a map, and nobody understands that better than Charlotte Fabro. For this singer-songwriter, Toronto is a city bursting full of diversity, culture, and talented people which all lending to a dynamic underground music scene. <br/><br/>
   Toronto’s unique feel and scenery is what led Fabro, a first year Creative Industries student, to create a YouTube series this past summer based at various locations around the city. In these videos, Fabro performs with her guitar at locations like the Distillery District, High Park, and the Harbourfront. This series not only helped Fabro improve her live performance skills, but allowed non-Torontonians to experience the city in an interesting way. <br/><br/>
  “I love the city so much,” Fabro exclaims. “I thought [the videos were] a cool way to explore places I haven’t been and to show people what it’s like to be here.” <br/><br/>
  Toronto is a major influence on Fabro’s music. Her iPod is a collection of various underground Toronto musicians, such as Justin Nozuka, Unbuttoned, and JP Saxe. Fabro, whose sound is a unique breed of soul, jazz, and funk, has drawn influence from many of these artists, particularly Allen Stone and Christian Bridges. She is interested in these artists because of their use of music as a social movement, which Fabro hopes one day to replicate in her own sound. <br/><br/>
  “I’m trying to be aware of everything around me,” Fabro says. “Music with a purpose is important to me.” <br/><br/>
  Fabro, who is self-taught in guitar, ukelele, drums, and piano, She has performed at various open mics throughout the city, including at some of her favourite venues like Free Times Cafe. Fabro was personally invited to play there by the cafe’s owner, who really enjoyed her music. Fabro is equally grateful to the Musicians@Ryerson open mics and events. <br/><br/>
  “I was actually going to drop out [of Ryerson] but one of the reasons I stayed was M@R,” Fabro admits with a smile. “I got the chance to play at [Groove Therapy], so I thought if I left then I wouldn’t have this anywhere else, so I decided to stick it out.” <br/><br/>
  Fabro’s set at Groove Therapy turned out to be one of her favourite performances of all time. The adrenaline rush of being on stage in addition to the support she received made it an unforgettable experience. <br/>
  “Everyone was just so welcoming and just felt the vibe,” says Fabro. “We all fed off of each other’s energy, it was awesome. I love being around people like that.” <br/><br/>
  While Fabro is thankful for the support she has received through Ryerson’s music community, she recognizes that being a musician isn’t easy. Although she has a great support system, her choice to pursue music as a career goal is not always met with enthusiasm. <br/><br/>
  “Music isn’t a path people usually choose to take, so you get a lot of disapproving looks,” explains Fabro. “They’re like, why are you doing that? Everyone around you is trying to fit you into a mould but sometimes you don’t want to go in that direction.” 
  However, Fabro is not disheartened by disapproval; she is passionate about her dreams. Her future goals are to release an EP and continue performing around the city. Fabro knows she will have to work to achieve her dreams and she is prepared to hustle, all while enjoying the ride. <br/><br/>
