Toronto-born artist Emsea is a one-woman band with creative force to be reckoned with. <br/><br/>

Marie-Claire Duquette is a guitar-slinging, mac-and-cheese enthusiast who specializes in alternative rock. Her sound ebbs and flows between urgent, angst filled resolves, and heartfelt melancholic rhymes, punctuated with rhythmic chord progressions - the product a lovechild belonging to Colbie Caillat and City and Colour. <br/><br/>

Duquette’s music career dates back as far as elementary school, when she was still taking piano lessons. Bored with the rigid conventions of classical structure, she soon found herself wanting a more organic outlet; the natural replacement – under the love  and guidance of her brother Eric Duquette – was acoustic and alternative music. <br/><br/>

The name “Emsea” was influenced by her childhood. Her friends would call her by the abbreviation “MC”, so Marie-Claire took the phonetic sound and spelled it out, giving her a creative way to keep her name, while changing it at the same time. <br/><br/>

Duquette explains that Eric’s ambition to pursue music as a career fell by the wayside as he began to feel the pressures and realities that come with trying to make it in the industry. It became “too real and too fast”, and so he moved on to other things, despite having played in bars since he was 13. <br/><br/>

 She was eager to follow in her brother’s footsteps, and by grade 9, had already established a name for herself on Youtube. Thus Emsea began to take shape. <br/><br/>

Eric is featured on several of Emsea’s covers on Youtube, and the two maintain a very close creative relationship, kindled by their extremely strong siblinghood. <br/><br/>

In fact, much of the content included on several Youtube entries, show behind the scenes outtakes of  loving support exchanged between the two talented musicians. <br/><br/>

Duquette said she loves collaborating with fellow artists and studio musicians, but when it comes to the final product, Emsea is the executive chef in her own kitchen. <br/><br/>

“I just want to hear my music the way it sounds in my head,” Duquette explains. “But it’s really hard to find the right people. Any person who is doing one thing differently can change the entire piece dramatically, so it all comes down to chemistry.” <br/><br/>

“[I swear] I’m not a diva,” she laughs. <br/><br/>


Duquette, 20, is studying her second year in Radio and Television Arts at Ryerson University, carving her name as a solo artist through every asset she can get her hands on, including advanced audio production classes.  <br/><br/>

“I’m covering a lot more than I actually need,” Duquette claims. “I learn how to do radio shows, live concert mixing, things that give you a better overall knowledge and more studio time,” she said. <br/><br/>

“It’s busy but I love the access to the business aspect.” <br/><br/>

Duquette also has an appetite and appreciation for concept art, applying her creative skills make collages and draw up sample album cover art on her spare time. She closely follows Little Comets singer, Robert Coles, and is humbled by his ability to write all lyrics, and create all of the band’s album covers.   <br/><br/>

Duquette confided that music gives her much needed space where she can unwind away from all the city noise. <br/><br/>

“I’m feelin’ the madness and it ain’t even March,” she joked. “But with music, it’s like going to the cottage every night.” <br/><br/>

She said it certainly gets hectic, but at the end of the day, music is her life and that’s exactly what she signed up for. <br/><br/>
