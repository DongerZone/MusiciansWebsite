In one of the many tourist squares of Verona, Italy, Ariel Dawn stands near a side street, flanked by two German musicians she met earlier at the hostel. Guitar in hand, it is her first time busking. 
<br /> <br />
	 The square is filled with vendors selling souvenirs and tourists weaving their way through them. Dawn subdues her nerves as she belts out Top 40 songs and the German musicians, one on a keyboard and another on a guitar, join in. Many tourists stop to hear the trio perform, dropping spare change into their hat as they part ways. 
<br /> <br />

	Backpacking around Europe was a great turning point in Dawn’s musical career. The summer after high school, Dawn and her best friend embarked on a three month trip to Europe. Dawn made the great decision of bringing her guitar along and set a goal of playing at least one bar in each city she visited. 
<br /> <br />
“Performing in so many different cities helped me grow confidence-wise,” Dawn explains. “Even if I didn’t grow skill-wise, it was still a great experience because being a musician is more than just what you can do, it’s how you do it too.”
<br /> <br />

	One of her most memorable performances was in a basement bar in Glasgow, Scotland. After performing a few songs, a man came up to Dawn and told her her voice reminded him of Chris Carrabba, the lead singer of Dashboard Confessional, who at the time was one of her favourite bands. 
<br /> <br />

	“I don’t even think it was my best singing,” Dawn admits. “It was just great that this random guy on the other side of the world compared to me to [Dashboard Confessional].” 
<br /> <br />

	Dawn’s music career began long before her trip to Europe. Her mother, who is one of her greatest motivators and inspirations, introduced her to music from a young age. She started with classical singing and opera, but admits that she wasn’t the biggest fan of either. It wasn’t until she began working on her own pop-rock music when she began to truly fall in love with music.

	Dawn has also been playing guitar since the age of 10, when she was locked in “an Avril Lavigne phase.” Now, she mostly uses guitar for accompaniment purposes to create and cover pop-rock tracks with an acoustic twist, as heard in her recent cover of Ed Sheeran’s “I See Fire.” <br /> <br />


	In high school, Dawn was actively involved in musical theatre. She took part in two plays that were nominated for Cappies, a prestigious theatre award in Ottawa. With her academic workload as a second year RTA student, Dawn hasn’t had the time to get involved with musical theatre. In the summer, she hopes to change that and participate in new productions. <br /> <br />

	“There’s nothing like the feeling of when [a play] comes together,” Dawn gushes. “I love being up on stage and seeing how it’s turned out.” <br /> <br />


	For now, Dawn is focusing on engaging herself in music. She aims to do one recording a month and attend open mics throughout the city. <br /> <br />


	“When I got to university, I almost forgot about [music] and thought I couldn’t go anywhere with it,” Dawn admits. “But I realized that’s not what I want and hopefully I can find people with likeminded attitudes.” <br /> <br />


	 Dawn has given a lot of thought to where music will take her in the next few years. Wherever music takes Dawn, she is determined to be happy. Her pursuits include starting a band, getting into musical theatre or “doing something crazy” like moving to New York or Los Angeles. Until then, you can find her performing at Musicians@Ryerson’s open mic nights. <br /> <br />

	“Music makes me not just a student,” Dawn says passionately. “I know there are tons of musicians, but [music] makes you feel like part of a community. It’s definitely something I am going to keep up.” <br /> <br />
