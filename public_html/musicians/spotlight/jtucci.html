"I really care about the music, so I try to put more intricacy into my guitar playing. But for me, I'm more about the words. I think I'm more of a storyteller than a musician."<br /><br />

Second-year journalism student Jacqueline Tucci follows the storyteller's suit by committing her musical "tales" to memory as well. The indie singer-songwriter and acoustic performer admits that she has never written down a single melody. While it may be a peculiar habit for a writer by profession, Tucci prefers to keep her music locked away in her mind. <br /><br />

"I think it's interesting to be a songwriter and journalist because they are such similar things, but in obviously different ways. Music is in a really weird spot because music is so deeply personal and journalism can't be," the soft-spoken Tucci says. "And at the end of the day, other people can still relate to it."<br /><br />

Not only is the Cambridge, Ont., native multitalented in her acoustic guitar performing and composing abilities, but she can also play a wide range of other instruments, such as the electric and bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, and drums.<br /><br />

"I play a little bit of a lot," Tucci admits. <br /><br />

Her love for music started eight years ago when she received an electric guitar for her 11th birthday. <br /><br />

"I wanted to play punk rock. I went to a Green Day concert in 2005, and that was it. I basically wanted to be in a band like that and play that music," she says. <br /><br />
 
In high school Tucci formed various bands with friends, like The Anarchy with Brandon Holmes and Perfectly Imperfect with Brandon Holmes and Mitch Camacho. <br /><br />

Tucci draws inspiration from everything, with hopes of making her songs relatable. While she doesn't limit herself to writing about Toronto, she definitely finds the city's culture and atmosphere to be a source for musical material. <br /><br />

Tucci's most recent EP, 'Nostalgic Nights', was released in October.<br /><br />

The EP's title comes from one night in particular, Tucci recalls. "It was four a.m. and I was listening to Sum 41. They were huge for me when I was little, before I was even into music," she says. "They were really pivotal in my musical upbringing."<br /><br />

While she may already have an EP released, Tucci is not ready to take a break. The young musician hopes to continue writing and making music that she can be proud of. <br /><br />
